                    Serbia.
                    I am a senior (fourth year) student in Computer science at
                    <a class="racunarski-link" onclick="window.open('https://raf.edu.rs/', '_blank')">"Racunarski fakultet"</a> in Belgrade. I love programming, for me,
                    it represents the way of life. The logic and thinking I got from it, helps me deal with everyday
                    situations. I'm
                    a very friendly and communicative person, and I love spending quality time with friends and family.

                    <p class="light">When it comes to books, I am interested in anything that makes me say, "Neat" to
                        myself, which could be anything on any given day. I love to learn, I love obscure details,
                        and I love to research things that interest me. Most recently, those interests are: best
                        practices
                        about coding, design patterns in programming, agile techniques, project management, etc.
                        Some of the best books on the subjects that I'm currently reading are:

                    <h5 class="center my-heading-italic">Hardware</h5>

                    <p class="light">I simply love working with hardware, especially computers. Since a young age I've
                        always
                        been intrigued by computers, their power and their capabilities. Step by step I learned to
                        assemble computers,
                        customize them, test their limits and components, and use them for anything that comes to my
                        mind. I'm also
                        interested in building some simple things with Arduino boards, that will automate some stuff
                        that I do
                        on daily basis.
                        My last project was a small fontain that I've built for my cat, nothing special, but she loved
                        it!</p>

                    <h5 class="center my-heading-italic">Martial arts</h5>

                    <p class="light">Everyone has to find a way to get rid of negative energy and emotions, and this
                        was mine.
                        I say "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bolder">was</span>" because I'm not practicing martial arts for quite some time now. I had multiple
                        injuries
                        on both of my shoulders and I had to make a long break. I still
                        watch it on TV every now and then and remember the days when I was in a top form and health. It
                        helped me develop
                        a different, better, mindset and improve my self-confidence. Some people might think that
                        martial arts are a violent sport, but trust me, it isn't. There are far more injuries and dirty
                        plays
                        in some "less violent" sports like basketball and football. Martial arts are, as its name says,
                        an art.</p>
